# Data-Driven Web Frameworks and Dashboards

This repository contains Python web frameworks for building data-driven dashboards using Flask, FastAPI, and Django.

## Projects

- **[Expression Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/yourusername/expression-analysis-dashboard)**: A dashboard for visualizing gene expression data.
- **[Bioinformatics Dashboard](https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-bioinformatics-dashboard)**: A bioinformatics dashboard for genetic analysis and visualization.
- **[BLAST App](https://github.com/yourusername/blast_app)**: A web application that integrates with BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) for sequence alignment and analysis.
- **[SMS Spam Detection Web App](https://github.com/yourusername/ml-inference-web-platforms)**: A Flask-based web application that uses a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. The app allows users to input a message and get a prediction on whether itâ€™s spam.


## Frameworks Used

- **Flask**: Used for building lightweight web applications.
- **FastAPI**: For fast, modern APIs.
- **Django**: For full-featured web applications with built-in ORM.
