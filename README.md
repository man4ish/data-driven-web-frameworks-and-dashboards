# Data-Driven Web Frameworks and Dashboards

This repository contains Python web frameworks for building data-driven dashboards using Flask, FastAPI, and Django.

## Projects

- **[Expression Analysis Dashboard](expression-analysis-dashboard/README.md)**: A dashboard for visualizing gene expression data.
- **[Bioinformatics Dashboard](interactive-bioinformatics-dashboard/README.md)**: A bioinformatics dashboard for genetic analysis and visualization.
- **[BLAST App](blast_app/README.md)**: A web application that integrates with BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) for sequence alignment and analysis.
- **[SMS Spam Detection Web App](ml-inference-web-platforms/README.md)**: A Flask-based web application that uses a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. The app allows users to input a message and get a prediction on whether itâ€™s spam.
- **[GWAS Summary Viewer](gwas-summary-viewer/README.md)** : A web application for visualizing GWAS summary statistics, including Manhattan and QQ plots. It allows users to upload genetic association data in CSV/TSV format and explore the data interactively.
- **[Single-cell RNA-seq Explorer](single-cell-rna-seq-explorer/README.md)**: An interactive dashboard for exploring single-cell RNA sequencing data, allowing visualization of gene expression across different cell types or clusters.
- **[Ollama Gene Reporter](ollama_gene_reporter/README.md)**: A FastAPI-based web application that integrates Ollama large language models for generating gene expression reports and interactive visualizations from uploaded CSV data.
- **[LLAMA3 FastAPI Web Application](llama3-fastapi-web/README.md)**: A web application using FastAPI to interact with the LLAMA3 model for text generation and natural language tasks.


## Frameworks Used

- **Flask**: Used for building lightweight web applications.
- **FastAPI**: For fast, modern APIs.
- **Django**: For full-featured web applications with built-in ORM.

## Setup

Follow the instructions in each dashboard's directory to get started.
